export const markdown = `Hello,

I'm a developer in search of a project partner to collaborate with on a new venture. I have an idea for a product that I believe has the potential to shake up the market, but I'm looking for someone with complementary skills to help me bring it to life.

Here are some key points about the project:

The product will be a web application serving a specific niche.
I've already conducted market research and identified a gap in the market that our product can fill.
While I have experience building web apps, I need someone with design and user experience expertise to make the app both visually appealing and user-friendly.
Most importantly, I'm seeking someone who is passionate about entrepreneurship and willing to commit the time and effort required to make this project a success.
If you're interested in learning more about the project or think you might make a good partner, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm excited to find someone who shares my vision and can help us bring this idea to life.

Thanks for your time!`;
